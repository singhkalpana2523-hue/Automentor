# 🚀 Automentor – AI-Powered Code Review System

Automentor is a web-based application that uses **Agentic AI** to analyze source code and provide intelligent feedback. It helps developers identify issues, understand them clearly, and receive actionable suggestions for improving code quality.

This project demonstrates the integration of **multiple AI agents** within a Flask web application to automate code review and mentoring.
